# AI Foundry Deployment Model Update

## Overview
Azure AI Foundry is transitioning to a unified platform-as-a-service offering, evolving from the legacy **hub-based** model to a **project-centric** approach. This change is designed to provide greater flexibility, improved resource management, and enhanced scalability for your AI workloads.

The project-centric model aligns with Azure AI Foundry's unified platform-as-a-service offering, delivering enterprise-grade infrastructure with streamlined management through unified Role-based access control (RBAC), networking, and policies under one Azure resource provider namespace.

Azure AI Foundry brings together agents, models, and tools under unified governanceâ€”enabling fine-grained cost tracking, unified RBAC, consistent networking and policy management, and centralized audit logging for all models and agents in one place. Previously, while resources were centrally connected and made available to projects, behind-the-scenes management was fragmented across multiple services causing fragmentation of RBAC, cost, and policy management.

---

## What's Changing?

### Legacy Hub-Based Model
Previously, deployments were managed centrally via an Azure AI Hub resource. Azure OpenAI and AI Services were connected to the hub so projects could use them, but deployments were managed on the individual Azure OpenAI and AI Services resources. This caused fragmentation of RBAC, cost, and policy management across multiple services. The hub provided:
- Centralized resource connections and configurations
- Hub-level security settings that cascade to projects
- Shared infrastructure with namespace isolation
- Dependency on Azure Machine Learning infrastructure for certain capabilities
- Fragmented management across up to 5 different Azure services behind the scenes

### New Project-Centric Model (Foundry Projects)
Each project is now managed through an **Azure AI Foundry resource** with unified governance. This provides:
- **Unified Resource Management:** Agents, models, and tools managed together under one Azure resource provider
- **Native Agent Support:** Full support for Azure AI Agent Service with general availability
- **Unified API Access:** Native support for Azure AI Foundry API to work with agents and across models
- **Project-Level Organization:** Projects act as folders to organize work within the resource context
- **Simplified Governance:** Centralized RBAC, cost tracking, and policy management
- **Enhanced Model Access:** Direct access to models sold by Azure (Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, xAI) and Partner & Community models through Marketplace

---

## Why Migration Is Required

**Important Clarification:** You do **not** need to redeploy your Azure AI Foundry resource itself. If you already have an Azure AI Foundry resource (formerly called "AI Services"), you can continue using it. You can also keep existing artifacts like model deployments.

However, to access the latest capabilities and unified governance model, you **must create new projects** within your Azure AI Foundry resource. Here's what needs to be created or migrated:

### 1. Project Creation Requirements
- **New Foundry Projects:** Must be created within your existing or new Azure AI Foundry resource
- **Agent Recreation:** Any existing agents must be recreated and re-run in the new project structure
- **Project-Level Capabilities:** For network-secured Standard Agent setups, supporting resources (CosmosDB, Search, Storage) can be:
  - Shared at the parent resource level across projects
  - Overridden at the individual project level
  - Managed exclusively at the project level
- **Data Isolation:** In all configurations, data isolation is maintained at the container level

### 2. Architecture Migration Benefits
The transition addresses several key improvements:

#### Unified Governance Model
- **Centralized Management:** Previously fragmented management across 5 services is now unified
- **RBAC Consolidation:** Role-based access control is now managed consistently under one namespace
- **Cost Tracking:** Fine-grained cost analysis for models and agents in one place
- **Policy Management:** Consistent networking and policy management across all components

#### API and SDK Modernization
- **Project Endpoints:** The Azure AI Agent Service uses project endpoints instead of connection strings
- **SDK Compatibility:** Current SDK versions support the new project-centric endpoint model
- **Unified API:** Azure AI Foundry API provides consistent contracts across model providers

### 3. What Can Be Preserved
- **Existing Model Deployments:** Azure OpenAI and other model deployments can be reused
- **Data Files:** Project files and artifacts can be migrated
- **Fine-tuned Models:** Custom models can be carried forward
- **Vector Stores:** Existing vector stores can be accessed
- **Connections:** Resource connections can be recreated (not automatically migrated)

## Architecture Comparison

### Legacy Hub-Based Model vs. Current Project-Centric Model

The core difference between the two models is **fragmented management** (legacy) versus **unified governance** (project-centric):

| Aspect                | Legacy Hub-Based Model                                 | Project-Centric Model (Current)                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Management** | Azure OpenAI/AI Services connected to hub<br>Deployments managed on individual services<br>Fragmented across ~5 services | Unified management under Azure AI Foundry resource<br>Agents, models, tools managed together |
| **Governance**         | Fragmented RBAC/cost/policy across services           | Centralized RBAC, cost tracking, policy management |
| **Project Organization** | Projects inherit from hub configurations               | Projects as folders within resource context    |
| **API Access**        | Connection strings and multiple service endpoints      | Unified Azure AI Foundry API with project endpoints |
| **Agent Support**     | Preview agents with limited capabilities               | General availability with full feature set    |
| **Data Isolation**    | Namespace isolation within shared resources           | Container-level isolation with flexible resource sharing options |

> **Summary:**  
> The legacy model required managing multiple Azure services with fragmented governance, while the project-centric model provides unified management and governance under a single Azure AI Foundry resource.
